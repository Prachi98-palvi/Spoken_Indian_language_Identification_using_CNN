# Spoken_Indian_language_Identification_using_CNN
 Audio identification, by converting audio files into spectrograms and then building an image identification CNN model is the base of this project.
Conclusion
Objective was to build a CNN model that classifies spoken indian languages
Data set had 7000 (1000*7) audio files for 7 different languages which were noise free
Audio files were converted to spectrogram (image for audio signals)
Image identification model of CNN was developed for these spectrograms
The model with learning rate 0.03 has highest accuracy 98.78 % for test data
We tested the model for random data files.
Future Scope
Model can be trained by adding some noise to data and be tested for live data series.
