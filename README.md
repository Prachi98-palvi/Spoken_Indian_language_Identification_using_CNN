# Spoken_Indian_language_Identification_using_CNN
 Audio identification, by converting audio files into spectrograms and then building an image identification CNN model is the base of this project.

1.Objective was to build a CNN model that classifies spoken indian languages
2.Data set had 7000 (1000*7) audio files for 7 different languages which were noise free
3.Audio files were converted to spectrogram (image for audio signals)
4.Image identification model of CNN was developed for these spectrograms
5.The model with learning rate 0.03 has highest accuracy 98.78 % for test data
6.We tested the model for random data files.

Future Scope:

Model can be trained by adding some noise to data and be tested for live data series.
