# Spoken_Indian_language_Identification_using_CNN
 Audio identification, by converting audio files into spectrograms and then building an image identification CNN model is the base of this project.<br />
 
 The data set can be downladed from here :<br />

 # Summary 

1.Objective was to build a CNN model that classifies spoken indian languages<br />
2.Data set has 7000 (1000*7) audio files for 7 different languages which were noise free<br />
3.Audio files were converted to spectrogram (image for audio signals)<br />
4.Image identification model of CNN was developed for these spectrograms<br />
5.The model with learning rate 0.03 has highest accuracy 98.78 % for test data<br />
6.We tested the model for random data files.<br />

# Future Scope:<br />

Model can be trained by adding some noise to data and be tested for live data series.
